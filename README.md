#Project Title: AI-Assisted Drug Discovery of DNA Gyrase Inhibitors Against Staphylococcus aureus

Objective:
To develop a machine learning pipeline to predict and validate novel inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus DNA Gyrase (CHEMBL3038482) using molecular docking, traditional ML models, and transcriptomic validation.

Methodology
1. Data Collection using public repositories(ChEMBL) and Target Protein Selection 
2. Data Preporcessing and Feature Engineering
3. AI Model Development
4. Molecular Docking Validation using AutoDock Vina/PyRx
5. AI Model Optimisation and Analysis comparing AI models and traditional molecular docking
