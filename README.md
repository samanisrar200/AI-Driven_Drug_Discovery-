#Project Title: AI-Driven Drug Discovery for Antibiotic Resistance Using Molecular Docking & Machine Learning

Objective:
•	Build an AI model to screen for potential antibiotic compounds.
•	Use molecular docking to validate promising hits.
•	Optimize the pipeline for rapid drug discovery

Methodology
1. Data Collection using public repositories(ChEMBL) and Target Protein Selection 
2. Data Preporcessing and Feature Engineering
3. AI Model Development
4. Molecular Docking Validation using AutoDock Vina/PyRx
5. AI Model Optimisation and Analysis comparing AI models and traditional molecular docking
